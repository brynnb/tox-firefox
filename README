A simple Firefox extension which transparently redirects your browser to x.com whenever you reach a page on xcancel.com.
Handy if you prefer using the official X/Twitter site instead of xcancel mirrors.

[Install for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xcancel-to-x)

## How to test
1. Ensure the extension is enabled.
2. Visit any xcancel.com URL (e.g., `https://xcancel.com/jack`).
3. You should be automatically redirected to `https://x.com/jack`.
